1. Apache: We will use this to run test cases in our program. Apache is a popular open-source software that provides tools for performance, load, and unit testing.

2. JUnit- an open-source testing framework specifically designed for writing and running unit tests in Java applications. It provides a set of tools and annotations that facilitate the creation of test cases, the execution of tests, and the assertion of expected outcomes.

3. SVG: Once the customer selects what box they want, the program will give them an SVG of the box. Scalable Vector Graphics is an XML-based vector graphics format for defining two-dimensional graphics, supporting interactivity and animation.

4. Java: A language that we will use to make the software around giving the SVGs for the boxes. Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language

5. JavaFX- JavaFX is a software platform and a set of graphics and media packages for the Java programming language. It enables developers to design, create, test, debug, and deploy rich client applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and 3D graphics.

6. GitHub: A proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code.

7. Repository: A repository contains all of your code, your files, and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your work within the repository.

8. Kerf: Is the width of the material removed by a saw or laser. The gap that's left after the cut is made.

9. Graphical User Interface (GUI): A visual interface that allows users to interact with software using elements such as buttons, menus, sliders, and text fields instead of typing commands.

10. Stage: The main window of a JavaFX app. It represents the top level container where all visual content is displayed.

11. Scene: A container that holds all the visual elements shown on the stage. A stage can display only one scene at a time.

12. VBox: A layout pane that arranges child nodes in a vertical column.

13. HBox: A layout pane that arranges child nodes in a horizontal row.

14. Controller: A java class that handles user interactions defined in an FXML file. It connects the UI elements to the program logic.

15. User Experience (UX): How easy and intuitive the app is for users to interact with, including layout clarity, responsivness, and feedback.
